                  <h2>Accumulator Mounting</h2>
                  <p>When designing the battery Mounting system on the HR19 vehicle it became apparent that our
                    chassis was not optimized for the fitment of our accumulator and this presented the challenge of how to attach the accumulator to the frame from a considerably large distance from the nearest tubes.
                  </p>
                  <p> The idea of creating railings for the Accumulator as a subchassis seemed the most viable option with the current state of the chassis.
                    By doing this, I was able to reduce the amount of components used from two brackets per mounting point to one bracket.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The brackets were designed to withstand 21.5KN of force in any direction with a minimum factor of safety of 1.5
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    These design objects were met and the design was ultimately successful and is currently in production for the upcoming EV FSAE competition in Lincoln Nebraska

                  <h2>Wheel Hub</h2>
                  <p>When I first joined Highlander Racing at UCR, I didn't know which project or team I wanted to be a part of.
                    As my first official project I chose to be a part of Drivetrain to design the Wheel Hub.
                  </p>
                  <p>Many of the first challenges from this project were simply to understand the purposed, placement, and functionality of the Wheel Hub.
                    Once I understood the fundamental role of the Wheel Hub, to support the loads of the vehicle being transfered through the wheel, I approached the issue with a few goals in mind.
                  </p>
                  <p>First, I needed to be sure that the weakest components of the Wheel Hub, the wheel stud holes, would be safe under cornering conditions. After running simulations considering
                    torques and remote loads and many iterations, I settled for a minumum factor of safety of 3. While this may seem high, I wanted to make sure that our first vehicle would be less prone to failure
                    as this was my first project for the club.
                  </p>
                  <img src="pictures/Wheel Hub/Wheelhub2-2.PNG" class="exp_pic img-fluid"/>
                  <p>Second, I needed to make sure that the rest of the system would be functional within the frame of the Wheel Hub. The planets of our double planetary
                     reduction gearset had to fit within the part without colliding on the inner walls of the mating pieces between the Wheel Hub and Planet carrier.
                     This was a fairly simple task but required constant coordination with the group to assure no changes would be made that could affect the alignment of the Wheel Hub.
                   </p>
                   <p>Ultimately, as my first project I understand that there was definitely room for improvement in the future in terms of manufacturability and weight reduction, however, and since I have applied
                     the knowledge gained from this project in those areas to simplify and reduce future projects.
                   </p>
